# **Explainable AI for Smoking Behaviour Detection: A Danish Medical Records Study**

This project implements a modular and reproducible pipeline for smoking status and pack-year classification from Danish clinical notes using a CNN-LSTM architecture with LIME-based interpretability.

---

## ðŸ§  What the Project Does

The methodology of this study builds upon our previous work [4], aiming to validate and extend the best-performing model. Specifically, we classify patients into:

- **Smoking categories**:  
  `Never Smoker`, `Current Smoker`, `Former Smoker`, `E-Cigarette`, `Passive Smoker`, `Unknown`
  
- **Pack-per-year categories**:  
  `Low`, `Medium`, or `High`

The model is trained using data from `pop1_merged.csv` and evaluated on `pop2_merged.csv`. It uses a hybrid **Conv1D + LSTM** architecture for sequence classification and LIME for explainable AI.

â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ config.py                 # Set task and model type
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ data_loader.py           # Preprocessing and tokenization
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ models.py                # CNN-LSTM model
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ train.py                 # Training and evaluation logic
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ explain.py               # LIME explanation with save as PNG/HTML

## ðŸš€ How to Run

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Place your data:
```
project-root/
â””â”€â”€ data/
    â”œâ”€â”€ pop1_merged.csv
    â””â”€â”€ pop2_merged.csv
```

3. Launch the notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook run_experiments.ipynb
```

4. To use LIME:
```python
from src.explain import lime_explanation
lime_explanation(model, X_test, sentence_index=0)
```

## ðŸ“Š Results & Interpretability

- Classification report and confusion matrix are generated after evaluation
- LIME explanations are visualized in the notebook
- Exported to both `.html` and `.png` for easy sharing
